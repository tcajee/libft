/*---<DECODE>---------------------------------------------------------{{{

In all cases, ls:
Assumes we always print the directory name
Clears all pending directories
Gets the current time for upcoming consistency checks
Initializes flags to a default value
Sets a default quoting style
Pulls column and tab size from the environment

Parsing
The largest helper function is decode_switches() at 579 lines. The function goes through each of the command line arguments to set flags used later during execution. Parsing switches answers these general questions:
What is the overall output format?
What are the specific formats? (time, inode, blocks, etc)
Are colors used?
How is the output sorted and ordered?
Is the search recursive?
Does the search follow links?
Switch decoding finishes by checking for consistency among options. Note that many options simply override others rather than failing (i.e. -l overrides -1).

Parsing failures
These failure cases are explicitly checked:
An invalid line or tab size
Invalid time style format

Execution
After parsing, the next step sets up the colors via the environment variables LS_COLORS or COLORTERM in that order.

We then set search behaviors. This means finalizing symlink handling and preparing for a recusrive search (if used). Some smaller details include current time zone, sort format, dired mode stacks, and hyperlinks.

The final step before processing is to set up the table data structure that we populate during file system traversal. The involves allocating the table and ensuring the sort order vector is clear. The initial directory (either user specified or cwd) is added to the processing queue and we're ready to go.

Processing directories
If only a single file is specified, that file is added to the file table and printed with print_current_files(). However, the typical case is that an entire directory is queued. This target directory (and eventually children) live in the pending_dirs list. These list members are checked for loops and then processed one at a time via print_dir(). Preparing directory output looks like this:

Attempt to open directory with the opendir() syscall
Check if the directory has been visited to avoid cycles
Clear the file table to prep for the new directory
Print the directory name, if appropriate
Repeatedly make readdir() syscall until all files processed
Check that file type isn't ignored
Add the file to the table (more below)
Handle any signals that may have arrived
Close the current directory with closedir() syscall
Sort the file table
Revisit the table entries and add directories to the pending list
Print the output of the file table (the cwd)
Printing output
Getting the files listed on the screen is the final step. This is more complicated than a call to printf() due to the variety possible output formats including a list of columns, a single list, many wrapped horizonal entries, and more. The most significant printing function is print_long_format(). In general, we walk file table and print the entries, which are already processed during add (gobble_file() - See below for details). The most in-depth printing call sequence worth exploring is:

print_current_files()
print_long_format()
print_name_with_quoting()
quote_name() - ends with fwrite() to STDOUT
print_color_indicator()
put_indicator() - The fwrite() here comes first
There are several ways that file processing could fail:

Failure cases:

Unable to open directory (doesn't exist, no permissions, etc)
Unable to stat file (doesn't exist, no permissions, bad path, etc)
Improper hyperlink formatting
Error reading directory
Unable to close directory
Unable to read a followed symlink
Extra comments
Adding a file to the file table
A file is added with a call to gobble_file(), the 2nd largest helper function in this utility at 332 lines. While printing all the files simply walks the table, outputting all of the lines, most of the work in ls happens as each file is collected and stored. To add a file we perform a subset of the following operations, depending on format required:

Ensure that the file table is large enough
Set the file reference in the file table
Verify quoting requirements
Construct the full name of the file
stat or lstat (if symlink) the file
Check capabilities
Check security context and access list
Construct the link name (if link)
Get widths: owner, group, author, security context, major/minor device, size, and inode
Return the total size in blocks

-1:	Force output to be one entry per line. This is the default when output is not to a terminal.
-l:	List in long format. A total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.
-g:	Implies -l. Display the group name in the long format output (the owner name is suppressed).
-t:	Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.
-u:	Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).
-r:	Reverse the order of the sort: -a descending lexicographical, -t oldest entries first, -none largest files last.
-f:	Output is not sorted.  This option turns on the -a option.
-a:	Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).
Multiple arguments
-G:	Enable colorized output. This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR in the environment.
-d:	Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively)
-R:	Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
